# Morse Encoder Based on PIC Microcontroller.

The PIC microcontroller is programmed, in assembly, to receive serial input data from terminal at 9600 baud rate, the parse and store the data in memory.

After having stored the data, a subroutine is called to process the stored data and generated the corresponding morse code, i.e. dots and dashes, as short and long up signals on an output port which is connected to a buzzer. 

This current project is simulated on Proteus 8.6 for Windows 10. Proteus is a PSpice-based electronics design and simulation software.
